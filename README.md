# MyReads: A Book Tracking App Project

Udacity Assessment project for FEND course. This is the project for tracking books through three book shlef categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read. We can move the books between these categories. Also it has book search page which renders the book results based on the 'search key words' defined in the file SEARCH_TERMS.md. From the search page results, we can move the book into the book shelf categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read. The newly moved book has been rendered into the respective category once we entered into Main page from the Search page.
